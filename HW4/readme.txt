Run this program by typing "dotnet run" into the console.
You will be asked to enter a correlation value between -1 and 1.
The console will display the standard normal random variables through the Sum Twelve method, Box-Muller method, and Polar rejection method.
It will also display correlated normal variables according to your entered correlation value.

In this folder is also the Jupyter notebook and Excel sheets I used to double check that the Polar Rejection method is indeed returning a normal distribution.
